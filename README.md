MY IDEA
We've made quite a few To-Do lists (and similar) in class, that I wondered how I might convert one of my favorites to the Database Application required in this assignment.

Conversion was not the easiest thing to do, actually, and I may have been better off to just start from scratch or to utilize one of our in-class lecture programs as a start.

I am still in progress and hoping to build-up the database today with a few more commits, time permitting.

With the turmoil of the last few weeks, I'll consider it a success if my servers are working and the database is connected correctly.
